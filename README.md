# Legacy C3 Development Test Code

This is code that we will use during the technical phase of the interview process.

## Setup
1. Clone repo to your machine.
2. Ensure that all Nuget packages have been restored.
3. Build in Visual Studio 2017+.
4. The code should run and display a Windows Presentation Framework UI.
5. Clicking the Send button should eventually generate an error message, after trying to send the email for several seconds.

## Additional Tips For the Interviewee

* Before the interview, ensure that the solution builds and runs successfully.
* Review the code and become familiar with the different parts of it.
* We will give you the actual coding exercise requirements once the interview has started.
* Ensure that you have any version of Visual Studio 2017 or higher, installed on the same machine with your Zoom client.
